# Contributing Guidelines

We are pleased to receive your support and contribution. By contributing to `react-mql`, you agree to abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/kumarabhishek/react-mql/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## General

Please make sure that there aren't existing pull requests attempting to address the issue mentioned. Likewise, please check for issues related to update, as someone else may be working on the issue in a branch or fork.

* Non-trivial changes should be discussed in an issue first
* Develop in a topic branch, not master
* Squash your commits

## Steps
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch: git checkout -b my-new-feature.
3. Ensure the test suite passes: (npm run test).
4. Commit your changes: git commit -am 'Add some feature'
5. Push to the branch: git push origin my-new-feature
6. Submit a pull request. Done.

## Linting

Please check your code using `npm run lint` before submitting your pull requests, as the CI build will fail if `eslint` fails.
